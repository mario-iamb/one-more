# Puglife app

### Introduction
Client-side product details & shopping cart app. 

App was built using: html5/sass/vanilla JavaScript.
Geo location API was implemented using [ip-api.com](http://ip-api.com/). Also [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) was used as front-end task runner.

## Usage

HTML, CSS and JS folders in the main directory contain the assets compiled and ready for deployment. `index.html` file inside the HTML folder is the main file to preview and test the app.  


## App development 

Building the theme requires [node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/).

From the command line:

   1. Install [gulp](http://gulpjs.com) globally with `npm install -g gulp`
   2. Navigate to the /webapp directory, then run `npm install`

You now have all the necessary dependencies to run the build process.

While still inside /webapp directory run `npm gulp` â€” which will compile and minify js/css assets for production.
